How the DialogFlow works :-

--> Dialogflow is a Google tool to build chatbots and voice assistants using NLP (Natural Language Processing).

--> It understands user messages and replies using intents, entities, and responses.

    Intent = action,
    Entity = details,
    Response = bot reply.

--> Ex:-

    Intent: What the user wants.
    Example: "Book a flight"
    
    Entity: Important data in the message.
    Example: "Delhi", "May 5" (city, date)
    
    Response: Bot’s reply.
    Example: "Your flight to Delhi on May 5 is booked!"
